# Documentation
At first sight, the tool can be a bit complicated to use.
In this documentation, I will try to explain everything you need to know about this tool.

## What is the difference between `Copy signature to clipboard` and `Copy HTML to clipboard` ?
Depending on your [email client](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_client) you will either have to literally COPY the signature (like if you select it with your mouse and then hit CTRL+C) or you will have to provide the HTML code of the signature.

So the difference is :
`Copy signature to clipboard` : Literally copy what you see of the signature
`Copy HTML to clipboard` : Just copy the HTML code of the signature

## Why is there only one `Edit` button ?
This can be really confusing, so let me explain :

When clicking on the red `Edit` button, it will look like you are editing only the first signature.
But no, when saving your modifications by clicking on the red `Save` button, it will apply them to all the signatures.

Like, if I am changing my free text area, the text editor will only pop up on the first signature, but the content of the editor will apply to all the signatures, and it's the same for every thing that is editable like the mobile phone number or the office place.
